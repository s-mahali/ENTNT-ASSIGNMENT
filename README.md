## Overview

This project is a **Dental Center Management System** developed as part of the ENTNT Junior Software Engineer technical assessment.

## How to Use
Admins/Dentists:

Manage patient records, schedule appointments, record treatments

Patients:
View their appointments, medical history, and treatment plans

## Testing Functionality

Login as a user (see credentials above)
Create a patient account after logging in as a patient
Login as admin to manage patients, appointments, and view statistics

## Architecture & Tech Stack
Frontend: React (with Vite)
State Management: Redux
Routing: React Router
Styling: Tailwind CSS & Material UI (MUI) components
Data Storage: Browser localStorage only (no backend)

## Known Issues
Some issues exist in incident management, patient name display, and appointment management.

Technical Decisions
All data is stored and managed in the browser using localStorage to comply with the assessment requirements (no backend).
Role-based access is enforced on the frontend for demonstration purposes.
UI is built with a combination of Tailwind CSS and MUI for rapid development and modern appearance.
The app is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Thankyou for reviewing this project! I look forward to your feedback.
